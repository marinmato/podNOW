Contains the front and back end for podNOW - a webapp that allows you to generate a podcast on any topic - as long as you can write it on the textbox. This is the MVP - I plan to add more functionality. 

In the immediate future, I want the app to: 1. Allow the users to download the mp3 file. 2. Give the users the option to choose the voices for the hosts. Right now, I am using Google Cloud TTS. 3. Offer the users 3 different lengths for the podcast, 5, 10 and 20 mins. 

I also want to work on the UI, but the focus is on the web-app functioning well first. Further down the line, I also want to implement a NLP, which would allow users to even write multiple sentences on the topic.

Other notes: I really have not done any research on other web-apps offering this service. I am sure there are plenty of them. I thought of the idea and wanted to bring it to life ASAP. No current plans to launch.
